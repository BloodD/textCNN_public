Val Orig :we were just in austin a few days prior , but it was fully booked and couldnt accommodate our last minute change of plans , so we found ourselves at the hampton inn ( practically across the street from our first stay ) . one thing nicer about this hotel is the included breakfast , but the downside is not being able to walk to the shops / restaurants at the domain ( poor us , we had to get ourselves in our car and drive 1 / 2 a mile ! ) . no complaints on the quality of this hotel ! top notch , its just that the first one had a location that couldn't be beat for the price !

Original     :the location is great , we paid extra for ts view . was very UNknown point for all our tours in manhattan , we actually didn't use public transporation , for 7 days of touring manhattan . didn't use any of their restaurants as they are too expensive and did not offer attractive menus at all , while there are so many offering of better and cheaper food outside . the only bad comment is the bad sizes . we reserved for two queens ( one parents and one for the kids ) . problems we got something like two twins ( less than 4 feet wide ) . eventually i had to sleep on the couch ( me any my wife are really small compare to avarage people so i really don't know how it can work out for other couples with kids )

Val Orig :the location was perfect . we were near the muni transportation and the staff was very helpful . the price is high but with walgreens around the corner , we were able to purchase items there to have breakfast in the room for our sleepy children . the beds were very comfortable but it was annoying to have only one sink and the toilet right near it in the bathroom . our room was near the parking garage so we were away from the noise of the street . if you are traveling with children , i would mention it so you give up a view to get the kids to bed . the city has enough views so we were grateful for a quiet room .

Val Orig :i arrived without a lot of time to spare before a dinner meeting due to flight delays and was informed that due to a leak there were no rooms unless i wanted a smoking room that required further deep cleaning . sounded like an excuse and more like they overbooked . had to ask valet to remove suitcase from car , too , by the way . was sent to sister property in an inconvenient location . they paid for 1 night and wanted me to re - pack and come back the next day . my other option when i pushed was to go next door to doubletree but that hotel has no restaurant . i would have appreciated a phone call to save me the time and trouble of going to that hotel for no reason .

Original     :my room at the hampton near the galleria came with a pricetag of $ 200 so i expected something better than that typical hampton room . however , i had no such luck . the lobby was average and the staff was friendly , but the hallways and some of the common areas were in disrepair and dirty . the elevators were particularly filthy . my room seemed fairly clean , but the old furniture screamed for updating . the worst part of the stay was the air conditioner . it was impossible to have the air on without the unit loudly clicking on and off every five minutes or so . changing the fan setting did not keep the unit at a steady noise . after two hours of trying to fall asleep , i had to resort to turning the unit off completely - not the best option in texas humidity ! if the hampton galleria wishes to charge inflated rates , they need to use the money for immediate updates - new furniture , better hvac , clean elevators . until those changes take place , this hotel will remain one to avoid .

Val Orig :dirty , older hotel . we stayed at the sofitel on this trip and it blew the michelangelo away . the michelangelo was tacky and run down . the staff was rude . the bellman complained that our bags were too heavy and asked us to take some of our own bags . another bellman was rude and condescending . only when it was time for a tip did he bother to even make an effort which was pathetic . the tub was dirty . the carpet was stained . not worth it !

Val Orig :my daughter and i stayed at the times square westin . i had requested a room with a view . we received a room on the 42nd floor and the view was all i could have wished for . we had a regular double - not hugely luxurious but quite comfortable - especially the beds . sound proofing was not great - the sound of the lifts was audible in the room . the room was big by new york standards and a bonus was that one could open the window . the lcoation was unbeatable - we could walk to a range of attractions . i found the UNknown excellent - at $ 249 a night . i would certainly stay there again .

Original     :the bel - air is really beautiful , quiet and cozy . the staff is pleasant ( though the concierge had an attitude ) . and you will run into the occasional movie star , which is fun . but the food and food service at the hotel is really quite poor and annoyingly overpriced . you really can't eat there , even for breakfast . luckily , there are a zillion great restaurants a short drive away . and yes , the rooms are " cozy " but that's a nice word for " a little small " . also , the bathrooms clearly need updating . my shower was a joke . ( i'm a guy who really appreciates a nice shower ! ) the bel - air is a very expensive place and yes , its beautiful , but by luxury hotel standards , its surprisingly mediocre .

Val Orig :i felt this hotel was a decent place to stay . they just upgraded their systems so that each room has wireless high - speed internet , in addition to the computer in the lobby . the rooms seemed clean to me and were spacious . you could request a microwave if you needed one and each room has a refrigerator . i didn't notice any planes flying overhead , though i did hear some of the water running from the top floor when i stayed on the bottom floor . the last time i went , my boyfriend booked his stay through priceline , but his reservation didn't show up . since they were booked for the evening , they told us to walk next door to get a room at the hampton inn . it was like a free upgrade . that was the best part ! apparently , it's a common thing that they do , to send people over to the hampton inn when they are booked and it is their mistake . the manager had no problem accommodating us .

Original     :beautiful hotel . it was a real treat to stay in the UNknown suite . dinner was fantastic at six seven . portions were on the smaller side in this " super - size " culture . definitely sit outside ! my only suggestion would be for the hotel to comp the $ 35 parking fee . especially , if you just spent $ 400 for a one night stay and $ 200 at hotel restaurant .
